We are always looking for more sponsors.

One of the aims of LambdAle is to make the ticket price as affordable as
possible. But we can only do that by relying on the generosity of sponsors.

Benefits for sponsors include:

* your logo on all promotional materials
* your logo, plus a company description, links, etc. on the conference website
* an individual introduction during the opening speech
* a free ticket to the conference

If you are interested in sponsoring LambdAle, please get in touch at
