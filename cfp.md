The CFP is now open!

Please submit your talks [here](https://www.papercall.io/cfps/943/submissions/new).

We are looking for:

* 30-minute technical talks about anything related to functional programming, aimed at any audience level from beginner to expert
* 30-minute non-technical talks - tell us about your hobbies, beer trivia, history of science, philosophy, fine art, beekeeping, that pizza recipe you’re so proud of, or anything else you’re passionate about!
* 10-minute technical lightning talks, both technical and non-technical

You can submit as many talks as you like (assuming PaperCall actually supports this! If not, just email us your extra submissions.)

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us at [info@lambdale.org](mailto:info@lambdale.org).
