title: Environmental impact
---
Let's face the truth: Conferences like LambdAle are not very environmental friendly. Tens or hundreds of people meeting for an event that typically lasts no more than a day ore two. Some live close-by and mostly come by public transport or car, but many fly in from other countries of the continent or even travel from overseas. It is especially these flights that account for a lot of CO2 emissions. We don't believe in flat earth, but we do believe in global warming and that flying is one major contributor to it. So let's call the spade a spade - conferences are an environmental disaster.

Yet we still believe that conferences are good and necessary. They are a way of people coming together to network and engage with each other in a way that is not possible by solely relying on online communication. Conferences inspire people to discover, invent and build new stuff and thereby help advancing the state-of-the-art of the industry and science.

So what can we do?

## Travel arrangements
LambdAle is held in London, Europe. Luckily, we have a very good train system in Europe. If you are coming from UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg or Germany, we encourage you to take the train. This is not only the most environmental-friendly means of transportation, but it also doesn't really take much longer if you take into account the added time for travel to/from airport, security control, boarding, luggage pick-up when flying. But even if you come from another European country, we recommend you to check the train connection.

Another alternative is to share a car to the conference. There are also many car-sharing platforms on the internet, where you might be able to find a lift.

## CO2 compensation
If you still need to fly, LambdAle is happy to announce that with the help of our [sponsors](/sponsors) and a share of the ticket prices we are going to CO2-compensate all the flights to the conference. CO2 compensation is a means to exchange CO2 emissions generated by flying with reducing CO2 emissions in another field (e.g. by investing in renewable energies) or extracting CO2 off the atmosphere (e.g. by planting trees). While the usefulness and efficiency of CO2 compensation is still a matter of debate and research, it is currently the best we can do.

## Reconsideration
We know LambdAle will be pretty awesome, but if you are planning to travel from a far-distant place like New Zealand or Chile please reconsider if it is actually worth the journey or if at least you can combine the trip with other conferences, meetings, holidays, etc.
