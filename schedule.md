## Talks

### Recursion schemes by example

Krzysztof Ciesielski ([@kpciesielski](https://twitter.com/kpciesielski))

Recursive data structures like trees, JSON objects and language expressions are
common elements of many codebases. We will explore Matryoshka for Scala - a
powerful tool for processing and transforming recursive data without the pain
associated with typical aproach.

#### About the speaker

Krzysztof is a software engineer from Poland, fascinated with the Scala
ecosystem, functional programming and principled design. He works at
SoftwareMill, building distributed systems in a distributed team. Additionally
Krzysztof engages in Open Source projects, with notable contributions to
Reactive Kafka, scala-clippy and other libraries.

### Hunting for Anglerfish in Datalakes

Dominic Egger ([@grafblutwurst](https://twitter.com/grafblutwurst))

Shiny technologies in big-data quite often turn out to hide some nasty teeth
whenever you dive deeper into your datalake. This is about taking on one such
anglerfish, namely Avro's generic representation, with the help of Recursion
Schemes.

#### About the speaker

I play video-, board- and pen&paper games, read a lot of SciFi, cook and code.
The latter I get payed for by Scigility. We mostly do big data platforms, from
platform engineering, to development as well as legal aspects, for companies
that don’t know how to do so yet.

### Declarative GTK Programming in Haskell

Oskar Wickström ([@owickstrom](https://twitter.com/owickstrom))

Functional programming has made a substantial impact on user interface
programming for the web, with virtual DOM technologies and unidirectional data
flow. Can the same be done in Haskell without compiling to Javascript and
Electron? In this talk you will learn about declarative programming of GTK
interfaces with Haskell.

#### About the speaker

After some years of musical education, Oskar Wickström began his journey  into
the world of software. He’s currently doing remote work in  Haskell, and in his
spare time he creates screencasts at
[haskell-at-work.com](https://haskell-at-work.com). Among the technical topics
that interest Oskar are functional programming, systems design, web technology,
and programming languages. His more aesthetic side, which mostly involves music,
draws  him towards graphics and UI design every now and then.

### FP and Event Based Systems

Hamish Dickson ([@_mishy](https://twitter.com/_mishy))

One of the more challenging things about designing event based systems is how
you deal with data conflicts. Here we talk about how CRDTs can be modelled as
semilattices and how you can derive them for case classes using Shapeless in
Scala.

#### About the speaker

I am an engineer at DriveTribe and am interested in FP, dependently typed
languages and machine learning. My background is in theoretical physics.

### There is a Bluebird in my talk that wants to get out

Lucas Fernandes da Costa ([@lfernandescosta](https://twitter.com/lfernandescosta))

There is a bluebird in my talk that wants to get out, but state machines are too
tough for him. This is not your usual functional programming talk. In it, I’ll
explain lambda calculus itself and show how exciting it can be to derive
combinators from the most elegant ideas in computability theory.

#### About the speaker

Well, I think the most important thing I can say about myself is that I love
learning and I really love creating things.

And, as I can’t stay away from writing the best code I’m able to, you can find
me writing software at Converge.io and (almost) every day on GitHub,
contributing to open-source projects and also helping to translate and produce
content for other developers.

I’ve been one of Chai.js core maintainers since 2015. Chai is one of the most
downloaded NodeJS modules and the most famous assertion-focused library around,
with outstanding 5.8 million monthly downloads and lots of dependents. I am also
a core maintainer of Sinon.js, which is another very popular project among
JavaScript developers and uses lots of meta-programming magic to accomplish its
tasks.

### Code in Code in Idris

Tom Harding ([@am_i_tom](https://twitter.com/am_i_tom))

Idris is getting lots of attention, and for good reason: in dependently-typed
languages, we can calculate types from runtime values! We’ll look at a
correct-by-construction simply-typed lambda calculus, and how dependent magic
blurs the boundaries between type and term, as well as function and data.

#### About the speaker

Writes Haskell and PureScript for Habito. Likes long walks on the beach, strong types, and hummus.

<a href="#schedule">^ Back to schedule</a>

### FUNCTORial programming

Marcin Matuszak ([@marcinmatuszak](https://twitter.com/marcinmatuszak))

Functors. Functors everywhere!

I dare say that Functor is most important building block of functional programming.

I will use my 30 minutes to defend this statement.

#### About the speaker

Marcin is an enthusiastic functional programmer from Wrocław, Poland. Working as
a Data Engineer at Ryanair. His recent interest is a mix of machine learning and
functional programming.

### Asynchronous Programming: Scala.concurrent and Monix

Yifan Xing ([@yifan_xing_e](https://twitter.com/yifan_xing_e))

Introduce the Futures & Promises library in Scala.concurrent and Monix. Dives
deep into the API implementations. Demonstrates nontrivial Future and Monix
examples. Compares and contrasts the obvious and subtle differences between
Future and Monix. Discuss best practices in debugging asynchronous systems.

#### About the speaker

Yifan is an open-source contributor, speaker, and ScalaBridge Boston organizer.
She built a back-end message queue system for the Scala open source project
Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) at Harvard Medical School.
The system uses concepts of parallel processing/multi-threading, non-blocking
asynchronous, distributed systems, etc. Yifan is also involved in bringing
diversity into the tech field. She is currently organizing ScalaBridge – Boston,
and the first workshop is planned for summer 2018!

Yifan has given a similar talk at Sphere.it in Krakow, Poland. Slides can be 
found [here](https://twitter.com/yifan_xing_e/status/986592958806970368)

### Types vs Tests

Julien Truffaut ([@julientruffaut](https://twitter.com/julientruffaut))

Tab vs spaces, vim vs emacs, types vs tests, our community is full of these
conflicts. In this talk I would like to discuss the latter: what is the impact
of types in our programs? Can types help write more efficient tests? if so, how?

#### About the speaker

Julien is the author of Monocle, a lens/optics library in scala and a
contributor to various functional libraries such as scalaz, cats or argonaut.

### ILLOGICAL ENGINEERS

Paweł Szulc ([@rabbitonweb](https://twitter.com/rabbitonweb))

Our industry is only 70 years old and we’ve already managed to repeat history
few times. Curry and Howard think they’ve found a workaround, but Russell and
Whitehead said they tried that already and Gödel spoiled all the fun. Dr. Knuth
however bet $3,372,548 on that idea, so who knows?

#### About the speaker

Pawel Szulc is primarily a programmer. Always was and always will be.
Experienced professionally in JVM ecosystem, currently having tons of fun with
Scala and Haskell. Humble apprentice of Functional Programming. Runs a blog
[rabbitonweb.com](rabbitonweb.com).

## Evening

After the conference finishes, you are welcome to stay and socialise in the venue. The pub is open until 1am!

You may also wish to relocate to the main bar downstairs.
