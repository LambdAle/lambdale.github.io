On 20th September (the day before the conference), we are pleased to offer a
one-day workshop on specifying distributed systems with TLA+.

Paweł Szulc is a well known developer in the community, and his presentations
and workshop about TLA+ have been widely acclaimed as 'must see' for all
interested in the subject.

In this training Paweł will introduce Leslie Lamport's TLA+ - a formal
specification tool with a model checker and proof system. The main objective is
to see how formal specification can quickly discover issues deeply hidden in the
corner cases of your design. You will gain a powerful tool that you can use in
your day job. Working with TLA+ will also allow you to think more abstractly
about your system. By using TLA+ you will make sure your software is more
resilient and has fewer bugs.
